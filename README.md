## Docs

 * [package help](http://godoc.org/github.com/pebbe/zmq3)

## Coverage

At the moment, the basics are here, and the first few examples from
[Ã˜MQ - The Guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all) are re-implemented
successfully. You can find these implementations in the
[examples](https://github.com/pebbe/gozmq/tree/master/examples).

The next goal is to re-implement all examples from The Guide, and expand
the library as necessary.

The final goal will be complete coverage of ZeroMQ version 3.
